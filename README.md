Multicolored Bouncing Balls


Based on one of the javascript exercises we did, which included the generation of random geometric figures and then giving them motion, I decided I wanted to further develop the idea by creating balls that would bounce off the perimeter and change their color every time they bumped into each other. The way the code works, it spawns 7 white balls and it gives them a random speed and direction. Once each ball bounces against one of the other balls, they will both change from white to a randomly chosen color.
